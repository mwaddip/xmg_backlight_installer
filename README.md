# XMG Backlight Installer

Installer and deployment helper for the **backlight-linux** GUI that controls the ITE 8291 RGB keyboard on XMG/Tongfang laptops. It ships the GUI, systemd user services, and system-level resume hooks so that the keyboard backlight is restored automatically after suspend/hibernate.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `source/` | Upstream scripts (GUI, restore helper, power monitor). |
| `install.py` | Top-level installer script to run with sudo. |
| `.gitignore` | Local development exclusions (bytecode, build artifacts, IDE files, etc.). |

## Requirements

* Linux distribution with `systemd` (tested on Fedora; other distros may need tweaks).
* Python 3.10+ with `pip`.
* Root privileges to deploy files under `/usr/share`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/etc/systemd`, etc.
* USB access to the keyboard controller (ensure `ite8291r3`-ctl works on your device).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darayavaush-84/xmg_backlight_installer.git
   cd xmg_backlight_installer
   ```
2. Run the installer as root:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 install.py
   ```
3. Launch **XMG Backlight Management** from your desktop menu and enable the automation toggles (resume + power monitor) if desired.

## Uninstallation

To completely remove the installed files and configurations:

```bash
sudo python3 install.py --uninstall
```

This removes:
- GUI scripts from `/usr/share/xmg-backlight`
- Launcher wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/xmg-backlight`
- Desktop entry and autostart files
- System-sleep hook and systemd drop-ins

**Note:** pip packages (`ite8291r3-ctl`, `PySide6`) are **not** removed automatically. To remove them:
```bash
pip uninstall ite8291r3-ctl PySide6
```

The installer performs these actions:
* Ensures `ite8291r3-ctl` and `PySide6` are installed via `pip`.
* Copies the GUI scripts (`keyboard_backlight.py`, `restore_profile.py`, `power_state_monitor.py`) into `/usr/share/xmg-backlight`.
* Creates a launcher wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/xmg-backlight` and a desktop entry under `/usr/share/applications`.
* Installs `/etc/systemd/system-sleep/xmg-backlight-restore` and a helper `/usr/local/lib/xmg-backlight-resume-hook.sh`.
* Adds drop-ins for `systemd-suspend*` services so the resume hook runs automatically, then reloads `systemd`.
* Probes for compatible ITE 8291 keyboards; if none are found you can abort safely and the just-installed driver will be removed automatically.

## System tray & notifications

The GUI now exposes two user-facing preferences (stored under `~/.config/backlight-linux/settings.json`):

- **Add in systray** – start the application minimized to the system tray and keep it running even when the window is closed. A tray icon provides quick actions (Show/Hide window, Turn on/off, Profiles submenu, Quit).
- **Show notifications** – toggle desktop toasts emitted by the tray commands (short messages such as "Minimized to tray").

The tray icon includes a **Profiles** submenu that lets you switch between saved profiles without opening the main window.

Both options live in the "Smart automations" card on the right-hand side of the GUI.

## Power-based profiles

You can assign different profiles for AC power and battery operation:

1. Create the profiles you want (e.g., "Bright" for AC, "Dim" for battery).
2. In the **Smart automations** section, use the "On AC" and "On Battery" dropdowns to assign profiles.
3. Enable the **Power monitor** toggle.

When the power source changes, the monitor automatically switches to the configured profile and applies it. If no profile is assigned for a power state, the current active profile is used.

## Profile management

The **Quick profiles** card provides full profile management:

- **New…** – Create a fresh profile with default settings (static white, brightness 40).
- **Save** – Save changes to the current profile.
- **Save as…** – Duplicate the current profile under a new name.
- **Rename…** – Rename the active profile.
- **Delete** – Remove the active profile (at least one must remain).

## Dark mode

Enable **Dark Mode** in the Smart automations section for a dark UI theme. The dark theme applies to the main window and all dialogs.

## Testing the resume hook

1. Trigger a suspend/resume cycle from your desktop environment.
2. After resume, confirm the keyboard lights restored automatically.
3. Inspect the log for troubleshooting:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -n 40 /tmp/xmg-backlight-resume.log
   ```
4. For additional diagnostics check:
   ```bash
   journalctl -b | grep xmg-backlight-hook
   ```

If the keyboard stays dark but manual restore works (`python3 /usr/share/xmg-backlight/restore_profile.py`), inspect the log file above to understand which phase failed.

## Development workflow

* Use the files under `source/` as the canonical payload: modify them there, then re-run the installer to copy updates into `/usr/share/xmg-backlight`.
* Keep the installer idempotent; re-running it should refresh dependencies and hooks without breaking existing installs.
* When adding system-level integrations (systemd units, hooks), place the generator logic in `installer/install.py` so that deployments remain reproducible.
* Run `python3 -m pytest` (if you add tests) or manual smoke tests: start the GUI, toggle automation, run suspend/resume, and inspect `/tmp/xmg-backlight-resume.log`.
